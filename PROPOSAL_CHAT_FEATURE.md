## ðŸ’¡ Example Conversation

**AI**: Hello! Let me analyze the proposal for North Region.

**AI**: Calculating priority score using MeTTa reasoning engine...

**AI**: CRITICAL PRIORITY - Priority Score: 78.5%

**AI**: Why This Proposal Requires Attention:
- High Poverty Rate (85%): Significant economic hardship
- Strong Impact Potential (90%): Substantial returns expected
- Environmental Concerns (75%): Conservation efforts urgent

**AI**: Recommended Allocation Rate: 78.5% of available budget

**User**: Why is the poverty index so high?

**AI**: The poverty index of 85% indicates significant economic hardship. This metric contributes 40% to the overall priority score, making it the most weighted factor. Immediate economic support programs are recommended.
