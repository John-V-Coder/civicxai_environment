## 🎯 User Interaction with Agent

Users interact with the AI agent through the **AI Gateway** (`/ai-gateway`):

### Form-Based Interaction
1. **Allocation Request Tab**:
   - Fill out allocation data form
   - Upload supporting documents (PDFs, images)
   - Submit for AI analysis
   - Receive recommendations with priority levels

2. **Explanation Request Tab**:
   - Provide allocation data
   - Request citizen-friendly explanations
   - Get AI-generated explanations

### Key Features
- Real-time polling for async results
- File upload support
- Health monitoring
- Metrics display

**Note**: This is NOT a chat interface - it's a form-based request/response system.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Toast Notifications Not Showing
- ✅ **Fixed**: All three toasters are now in App.jsx
- Check browser console for errors

### Login/Register Not Working
- Verify backend is running
- Check API endpoint configuration in `services/api.js`
