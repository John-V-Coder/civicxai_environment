CivicX Knowledge System
Overview

CivicX is a complete cognitive knowledge system designed to support reasoning, learning, and intelligent information management. It processes data, performs logical inference, and continuously improves through adaptive learning.

Implementation Summary

All five development phases are complete. The system includes a reasoning engine, learning components, document understanding, causal inference, and visualization tools.

Phase Summary

Phase 1 – Foundation

Established the core knowledge base and reasoning structures.

Implemented AtomSpace for storing and retrieving concepts.

Phase 2 – Knowledge Ingestion

Automated document processing pipeline.

Extracts key ideas and transforms them into structured atoms for reasoning.

Phase 3 – Reasoning Engine

Added probabilistic logic reasoning and confidence scoring.

Supports chain reasoning and concept linking.

Phase 4 – Integration and Orchestration

Introduced a central orchestrator to route queries intelligently.

Integrated document-based queries and hybrid reasoning workflows.

Phase 5 – Learning and Causal Reasoning

Implemented causal relationships, feedback loops, and performance tracking.

Added self-improving routing logic and graph-based explanations.

Core Capabilities
Knowledge Management
pipeline.process_pdf_file('report.pdf', 'Report_1')
knowledge.add_region('Region_X', {'poverty_index': 0.8})
knowledge.add_concept_similarity('Poverty', 'Economic_Hardship', 0.9)

Reasoning and Inference
reasoner.reason_with_pln(premises, goal)
reasoner.multi_hop_inference('Poverty', 'High_Priority')
reasoner.compare_with_confidence('Region_A', 'Region_B')

Causal Analysis
causal.add_causal_relation('Poverty', 'Low_Development', 0.85, 0.9)
effect = causal.estimate_causal_effect('Poverty', 'Priority')
what_if = causal.counterfactual_reasoning(actual, counterfactual)

Learning and Adaptation
learning.record_feedback(query, response, routing, score)
performance = learning.get_routing_performance()
suggestions = learning.suggest_improvements()

Visualization
graph = viz.generate_full_graph()
subgraph = viz.generate_subgraph('Poverty', depth=2)
causal_graph = viz.generate_causal_graph()

Query Examples

“What documents mention poverty?”

“Find sources about resource allocation.”

“Show research on deforestation.”
Each query returns supporting documents, reasoning context, and confidence levels.

System Architecture

The CivicX system combines a reasoning core, orchestrator, and learning engine connected to a shared knowledge base.

Orchestrator: routes and optimizes query handling.

Knowledge Base: stores structured concepts, links, and relationships.

Reasoning Core: performs logical, causal, and multi-hop inference.

Learning Engine: refines performance through feedback and data.

Visualization Tools: present insights as interactive knowledge graphs.
