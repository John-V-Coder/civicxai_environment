## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Calculation Logic

**Priority Score Formula:**
```javascript
priority_score = 
  (poverty_index × 0.40) +      // 40% weight
  (project_impact × 0.30) +     // 30% weight
  (deforestation × 0.20) -      // 20% weight
  (corruption_risk × 0.10)      // 10% penalty
```

**Allocation Percentage:**
```javascript
allocation_percentage = 
  (priority_score × 100) × scaling_factor
```

### Smart Analysis Functions
